    <h2>The History</h2>
    <p>
      The first NCAA basketball March Madness tournament began on March 17th, 1939, and it started as an eight team single-elimination playoff tournament to crown the first ever national college basketball champion, which ended up being the Oregon Webfoots who are now known as the Oregon Ducks. The tournament grew to 16 teams in 1951, and in 1975 the tournament capacity doubled and became 32 teams. Since that time, the tournament has blossomed to become the 68 team single-elimination tournament that is now one of the top-watched sports events in the entire United States. The tournament is known across the globe as &quot;March Madness&quot; because it is held in March and it is one of the only single-elimination playoff tournaments across all sports, so this means any team can win a game depending on how the team plays in that specific game. The term March Madness was actually first used by a high school ref back in 1939, but it wasn't associated with the NCAA tournament until 1982 when a commentator named Brent Musberger used it when covering the tournament. The largest comeback in NCAA tournament history was in 2001 was by the Duke Blue Devils when they overcame a 22 point deficit against Maryland in the tournament. Duke went on to win the NCAA championship that season. Only 9 players in NCAA tournament history have more than 300 points in NCAA tournament history, and this list includes greats such as Glen Rice, Oscar Robertson, Danny Manning, Elvin Hayes, and Christian Laettner who headline the top 5. Christian Laettner has the most points in NCAA tournament history with 407, and playing in an NCAA tournament record of 23 out of the 24 possible games in 4 years. This means he made it to the final four all four years of his college career, and made it to the national championship 3 out of those 4 years. Christian Laettner 21 total NCAA tournament games in his career which is also a record, while winning back to back championships with Duke in 1991 and 1992. The single game record for scoring in one game was 264 points set in 1990 when Loyola Marymount beat Michigan 149-115 in the second round of the tournament. The highest scoring game by a single player in the tournament is a record of 61 points set by Austin Carr in 1970 when Notre Dame played Ohio. UCLA has the most national championships in tournament history with 11, and 7 of those titles were won in consecutive years which is also an NCAA record. Duke's coach, Coach K, has the most final four appearances by a single coach with 13. Coach K also has the most NCAA tournament wins by a single coach with 101 under his belt. No other coach in the history of the game has over 80. Overall, this tournament has a very lengthy history that will continue to be written as time goes on.

    <h2>The Brackets</h2>
    <p>
      The brackets are what make March Madness really special. Every year, a team of bracketologists analyzes the skill and record of every team in the nation, and they place the top 68 college teams in the nation in a huge bracket that consists of four regions where each team is placed into a region and seeded from 1-16. 8 of the 68 teams are placed into four play-in games, which determines if they get to play in the main tournament or not. Once those games are done, the 64 teams in the main tournament play their first games against the oppositely seeded matchup in their region. This means 1 seeds play 16 seeds, 2 seeds play 15 seeds, etc. Every year, every major sports publication holds a contest where people choose who they think will win each matchup in the tournament, and they are all aiming to achieve the impossible: a perfect bracket. This feat isn't completely impossible, but it's about as close to impossible as you can get. There are 63 games throughout the tournament, so to get a perfect bracket you must pick the winner of each game in the tournament 63 times in a row. Essentially, you have a 50% to get each game right, so the probability of getting 63 games right in a row is 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808. This means you have a 0.000000000000000010842022% chance of achieving this ultimate goal. This might help you believe the fact that nobody has achieved the dream of attaining a perfect bracket, because of how hard it is. In fact, the closest recorded bracket in NCAA history to getting a perfect bracket picked 49 games correctly in a row before busting due to Tennessee's loss to Purdue in the second game of the sweet 16 that year. This means this person picked every game in the round of 64 correctly, every game in the round of 32 correctly, and the first game in the sweet 16 correctly before the streak ended. This is insane when you truly think about it, because this person was only 14 games away from achieving the ultimate goal. 14 games may seem like a lot, but it's the closest we've ever seen anyone get in a verifiable bracket. Millions of people make brackets every year in pursuit of this ultimate goal, but it's also very fun to compete with your friends and family to see who has the best bracket in the very end.

    <h2>The Madness</h2>
    <p>
    Upset. This may be the most popular term used in the sports world during March, due to the amount of upsets that happen during March Madness. Cinderella stories have been born out of 15 seeds beating 2 seeds and advancing all the way to the sweet 16, 11 seeds making it all the way to the final four, and the 8 seeded Villanova Wildcats winning the National Championship in 1985 in the first 64 team tournament of all time. They remain the lowest seed to ever win a March Madness championship, and 1 of the 4 teams lower than a three seed to ever win the 64 team single-elimination tournament in the 36 years that this version of the tournament has existed. In that time period, 23 one seeds have won the championship, 5 two seeds have won the championship, 4 three seeds have won the championship, and one four seed, one six seed, one seven seed, and last but not least, the wildcats as the only eight seed to ever win the championship. This means a five seed has never won the championship, and neither has any seed from 9-16. Before the 2018 March Madness tournament, a 16 seed had never beaten a 1 seed in the tournament, as 16 seeds were 0-135 against 1 seeds since the first 64 team tournament was played in 1985. On March 16, 2018, the last 1 vs 16 seed game, however, made history, when the 16 seeded UMBC Retrievers blew out the number 1 overall seeded Virginia Wildcats with a score of 74-54. Upsets are the best thing about March Madness in my opinion because I love seeing top teams in the nation fall to mid-majors and teams who are never talked about in the discussion of the best teams in the NCAA. This season, many upsets have happened. St. Peters, a 15 seed, defeated the 2 seeded Kentucky Wildcats in the first round of the tournament and they just recently became the first 15 seed to ever advance to the elite 8, before losing to UNC in the game to advance to the final 4. Their miracle run has cemented them into NCAA tournament history forever, and I'm glad I personally got to watch every game on their path to history. Only Kansas remains as the final 1 seed left in the tournament, after Baylor lost to 8 seeded UNC in the round of 32, Arizona lost to 5th seeded Houston in the sweet 16, and Gonzaga, the number 1 overall seed in the nation, lost to 4 seeded Arkansas in the sweet 16 as well. The current final four setup has 2 seeded Duke and 8 seeded UNC facing off on the left side of the bracket, while 2 seeded Villanova and 1 seeded Kansas face off on the right side of the bracket. Duke vs UNC is commonly regarded as the greatest rivalry in college basketball history, and some regard it as the greatest rivalry in all of sports (me included). This is the first time they will ever face off in the NCAA tournament, and the game being in the final 4 makes the matchup infinitely more suspenseful. Duke's coach, coach K, who is commonly regarded as the greatest coach in college basketball history and who some regard as the greatest basketball coach of all time, is in his last season and his team is looking to get a final championship under his belt before he leaves the coaching scene. This game may go down as the greatest game in NCAA tournament history, and whoever wins this matchup between these rivals will have the ultimate bragging rights over the other team forever. This will be the most important game in Coach K's entire career, because if he loses to UNC as his final game he ever coached his legacy will have a bad look forever, but if he wins against UNC and he ends up winning the championship, I believe this tournament win will forever solidify him as the greatest basketball coach to ever live and he will end his career on the winning side of the greatest rivalry in sports. This is what the <strong>tournament</strong> is all about. This is what <strong>basketball</strong> is all about. This is <strong><em>March Madness</em></strong>.</p>
